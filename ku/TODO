2. Zero MQ style addressing?
3. MsgPack
4. Read/Write RingDeque?

PollLoops can have virtual base

Resolver receives:
inproc://#1
ipc:///tmp/fusion/s
tcp://192.168.1.1:3333
pgm://
ws://
and creates Endpoint

Thoughts:
1. Unix domain socket is the way to go for normal case IPC
2. Shared memory is said to be faster for small amount of data, think of using it for things like market data, maybe making it explicit with separate addressing like shm://.....
3. Not seen advantage of fifo over unix domain socket yet

4. We might consider 2 categories of communication: shared type and socket type
shared type: inproc, shm
socket type: all others

5. Think of a separation between "communication merchanism vs communication entities", e.g., Although inproc defaults to shared, you can always use sockets, even for inproc

UserEventConnection ?
swap resource between read/write buffer to move resource into thread

inproc publisher knows the number of subscribers n, initiate eventfd counter to UINT64_MAX - 1 - n, and always try to write n
